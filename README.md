# GiftCardPal
This full-stack mobile-friendly application is built with the MERN stack and stores user's gift cards in a database for quick and easy access. 

## How it Works
Create an account or log in to get started. Once you've succcessfully logged in or created an account, you will be brought to the homepage, where you can add a new card. Your virtual wallet will update in real time as new cards are added or removed. Click on a card to update how much you have spent, and see a live update of your card's balance. If you've used up your balance, remove the gift card from your wallet. Users also can easily filter by category to only see their cards that relate to dining, retail, etc.

## Try It
This application is [hosted on Heroku](https://giftcardpal.herokuapp.com/), so no downloads are necessary to use. Create an account to start adding gift cards to your wallet.

### Run Locally
Clone this repository. cd into the repository and open in your code editor of choice. Open the server.js in your terminal. Type yarn start to run the local server.
